# Honour Code

Absolute academic integrity and honesty are expected from each student participating in the course. Please read the rules of the course carefully and follow them.

**Homework**:
You can collaborate with others and freely consult online references and books on the homework provided you meet the following conditions: 
- You acknowledge everybody you worked with in your submission and cite all references that directly helped for each homework problem.
- You write your own solutions and code independently without referring to written notes and other material from joint discussions.
- You must internalize any solution/code you submit well enough to reconstruct it fully by yourself (we may test this).
- NO sharing (willing, unwilling, knowing, unknowing) of written/typed-up reports or assignments or code between students is allowed. In particular, copy-pasting solutions/code from others or from the internet is not allowed). 
- NO submission of downloaded material (from the internet, Campus LAN, or anywhere else) is allowed.

**Project**:
- You have to conduct the project work yourself (with your team). You cannot submit somebody else's work as your team's. In particular, the project must NOT be copied/downloaded material from the internet or elsewhere.
- This project cannot be used "as is" for other courses. Similarly, projects from other courses cannot be used "as is" for this course. You are allowed to build on past course projects for this course.
- You are allowed to reuse the course project for your own research (e.g. BTP/DDP/MTP/other research projects).
- You are also allowed to spin off a part of your own research project as this course project, as long as you use some tools introduced in the course. Please check this with the instructor at the time of submission of the course proposal.

**LLM Policy**:
You may use LLMs for your homework and project provided you meet the following conditions: 
- You list the name of the LLM and the exact prompt verbatim. 
- A summary of how the LLM helped.


Academic violations will be handled by the IITM Senate Discipline and Welfare (DISCO) Committee. 
Typically, the first violation instance will result in ZERO marks for the corresponding component of the Course Grade and a drop of one penalty in the overall course grade. 
The second instance of academic dishonesty will result in a ’U’ Course Grade and/or other penalties. The DISCO Committee can also impose additional penalties.

Please take steps to protect your work. Do not share your email/LDAP/Moodle/Piazza/Gradescope passwords with anyone. Do not share your academic drive space on the campus LAN.
