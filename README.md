# Privacy in AI



## Course Description

As AI rapidly advances, so do concerns about data privacy and responsible data usage.
This course explores these areas with foundational mathematical principles, cutting-edge research, and practical applications.
We will focus on rigorous mathematical tools (with proofs), algorithm design for practical applications, and implementation.
Topics include: privacy risks, differential privacy & properties, private learning algorithms,
protecting against data reconstruction. We will also cover a sampling of advanced topics including privacy in distributed and federated learning,
emerging challenges of privacy and copyright in LLMs and GenAI, federated learning, and unlearning.

See the [course calendar](calendar.md) for up-to-date syllabus.

## [Piazza]() & [Gradescope]()

We will use Piazza for communication and Gradescope for submitting assignments, project reports, etc.

## Lectures

Location: **CRC 205**. Classes will be in Slot J ([weekly schedule](schedule.md)).

## Grading

- Homeworks: 35% (5% for a review HW0, 10% each for HW1-3)
- Midterm: 20%
- Course Project: 40%
    * Proposal: 5%
    * Midpoint Report: 10%
    * Presentation: 10%
    * Final Report: 15%
- Scribing: 5%

## Homework

### Instructions
- Please submit your solutions via Gradescope.
- The assignments should be typeset in LaTeX (you may use [this LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rfpgcwqbtdcg#cb8bba)). Please do not submit handwritten notes.
- For the mathemtatical problems, please be succinct and justify all the steps. Proofs are required to be fully rigorous and justified.
- You have a total budget of 3 late days for homeworks (and scribing), no questions asked. A submission a few minutes after the deadline will also count as a full late day. Further delays after exhausting the late day budget will result in a zero grade for that homework.
- For coding assignments, please submit executable Jupyter notebooks together with a PDF export to gradescope.

### Collaboration Policy

## Course Project Details


## Notes for later
Just the Class is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course websites. In addition to serving plain web pages and files, it provides a boilerplate for:

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- a [course calendar](calendar.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,
- and a weekly [schedule](schedule.md).
