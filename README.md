# DA 5001 / DA 6400: Privacy in AI 

### Term: Jul-Nov 2024 @ IIT Madras

### Instructor: [Krishna Pillutla](https://krishnap25.github.io/)

### [Announcements](announcements.md)


## Course Description

As AI rapidly advances, so do concerns about data privacy and responsible data usage.
This course explores these areas with foundational mathematical principles, cutting-edge research, and practical applications.
We will focus on rigorous mathematical tools (with proofs), algorithm design for practical applications, and implementation.


**Topics**: privacy risks, differential privacy & properties, private learning algorithms,
protecting against data reconstruction. We will also cover a sampling of advanced topics including privacy in distributed and federated learning,
emerging challenges of privacy and copyright in LLMs and GenAI, federated learning, and unlearning.

See the [course calendar](calendar.md) for up-to-date syllabus.

## [Piazza]() & [Gradescope]()

We will use Piazza for communication and Gradescope for submitting assignments, project reports, etc.

## Lectures

Location: **CRC 205**. Classes will be in Slot J ([weekly schedule](schedule.md)).

## Grading

- Homeworks: 35% (5% for HW0, 10% each for HW1-3)
- Midterm: 20%
- Course Project: 40%
    * Proposal: 5%
    * Midpoint Report: 10%
    * Presentation: 10%
    * Final Report: 15%
- Scribing: 5%

## Homework

We will have 4 homeworks total. HW0, released on the first day of class, is meant to be a review (5% of the grade).
The other 3 homeworks are worth 10% each.

### Instructions
- Please submit your solutions via Gradescope.
- The assignments should be typeset in LaTeX (you may use [this LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rfpgcwqbtdcg#cb8bba)). Please do not submit handwritten notes.
- For the mathemtatical problems, please be succinct and justify all the steps. Proofs are required to be fully rigorous and justified.
- You have a total budget of 3 late days for homeworks (and scribing), no questions asked. A submission a few minutes after the deadline will also count as a full late day. Further delays after exhausting the late day budget will result in a zero grade for that homework.
- No late days will be allowed for project-related deadlines.
- For coding assignments, please submit executable Jupyter notebooks together with a PDF export to gradescope.
  

### Collaboration Policy

You can collaborate with others on the homework, provided: 
* You acknowledge everybody you worked with in your submission. Similarly, external resources you consulted should also be cited.
* You write your own solutions and code independently without referring to written notes and other material from joint discussions. In other words, you must internalize the solution/code well enough to reconstruct it fully by yourself.
* Copy-pasting is strictly not allowed.

## Course Project Details

The course will involve a final project to be performed in groups of 2 or 3 (exact details TBD).

The course project can be one of the three types:

* **An original research project**: can be theory/applied/both. Your are welcome to work on your own research project, as long as it involves a component related to privacy in AI.
* **Implementation**: benchmarking existing algorithms and open-sourcing by creating your own package or contributing to existing ones.
* **In-depth paper analysis**: read and analyse the results of a theoretical paper, and reproduce the proofs in your own words.

The project will require a proposal (due end of September), a midpoint review (due 3rd week of October), a presentation (week of Nov. 4th), and a final report (due around Nov. 14th).
These details will be annouced in the calendar.
